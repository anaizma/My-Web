    <h1>My Journal</h1>
    <p>My name is Ana and this is my very first website!!! Jk, not my first website but my first time using vscode and github and doing anything like this</p>
    <p>So I finally started working on this site again. It's for you - surpirse!!!!</p>
    <p>Sooo iggy's bday is coming up and something he asked for is me to "find something that I really like to do and actually enjoy it and do it"</p>
    <p>Umm that's gonne be really hard cause I feel like I've hit a wall right now and I don't like to do anything at all</p>
    <p>So there I was thinking about things that I like, and something that I really like is... well you. For months I've been thinking (from even before we started dating) about what to get you for your birthday.</p>
    <p>I mean, what do you get the guy who has everything? I thought about buying him airpods since he lost an earbud but I think he bought some off of Facebook Marketplace already so that idea was a flop.</p>
    <p>Then I thought about getting him some Vans (hehe I know his shoe size) but he wont tell me his address in Washington sadly. I was gonna get Makoye's contact and ask him for the address but what if he doesn't know it? Also iggy has very selective taste and lot of shoes so what if he doesn't like them?
    </p>
    <p>So I'm thinking about still getting his address somehow (tbh no clue how I will get it) and then doordashing a little cake to his place. I don't think he will celebrate by himself and I really wish I could be there with him.</p>
    <p>Oh my other brilliant idea was to surprise him in Washington. If I could've stayed in Cleveland, then I would've bought a plane ticket over the weekend and surprised him and no one would have to know. But, that sadly did not work out</p>
    <p>Anyways, so I like Iggy, a lot, and he taught me all of this and I know that he really wants to me to actually apply myself and learn, so I'm going to try and make a website for him as his birthday gift</p>
    <p>I don;t really know what I am doing but I'm determined to do this for him so ofc I will figure it out</p>
    <p>Andddd I'm gonna document it in this page journal entry style yk? Just so he has a little sneak peak about what goes on in my mind. For the past year, I've been writting a lot of my thoughts down in my journal or in my notes app and I've come to realize that I really enjoy writting. It's very theraputic for me I feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders when I write</p>
    <p>A lot of my writting is me working through my emotions and what I'm feeling sooo, just know that my emotions are all over the place but writting about it is something that I like and is important to me. It's my personal therpey</p>
    <p> So yeah, that was some of the background information into making this. And as always, I love you my Iggy.</p>
    <p>Okayy so what I did today was figure out how to reuse git hub and make this thing private and password protected so no one can see it yet</p>

    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>I realized that I forgot a lot of the Linux commands that Iggy taught me. I had to use chat to figure out how to recover my fies and was searching up how to do things. But I think that I am familiar with everything now. I don't really want to rely on ChatGPT though so I created a doc page where I am going to document all of the commands that iggy taught me and everything else I learn.</p>
    <p>Also, this website is really personal to me and I don't want random strangers to access to. It's just for my Iggy. So what I did was that I added a simple password to access the website and I made the Github repository private. So even Iggy can't accdentlaly see it and ruin his surpirse. Hoepfully he likes this? I know he doesn't like surpirses.</p>
    <p>So that is basically all I am going to do on this first day. It's almost 1am right now and I'm kind of tired so I'm going to sit in my bed, scroll, and go to sleep. I have to repsond to so many people that I have been ghosting as well.</p>
    <p>I texted Iggy but he hasn't responded so he might be asleep. He had a long day at work so I'm hoping he gets his rest. That's enough for today though, Goodnight!</p>

    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>So back for more. I'm currently on call with Iggy right now. He's asleep though and I'm just listening to him softly snore in the background as I work on this. So far today, I've set up the journal page, and formatted it a bit. Nothing really aside from skeleton work. I'm going to work on the css tomorrow hopefully.</p>
    <p>It's currently 2am right now so my sleep schedule is still screwed. I really need to fix that. Oh- the phone just disconnected. Think Iggy's phone died. Hopefully he can rely on his body clock to wake him up for work tomorrow. I don't want him to be late.</p>
    <p>So for what I did today: It was my sister's bday so I gave her the jewlery stand you helped me make (by help it was mainly all you). Thank you so much for that. She absolutly adores it. Thank you for actually sitting with me, designing it, and reprinting it to make it perfect. I really appreciate you doing that for me.</p>
    <p>I don't think you relaize how amazing of a person you are. You're always so undertsanding and trusting of me. You never judge me for my feelings and you make me feel like my emotions (no matter how stupid they are) are valid. You're so gentle, always making sure that I am okay with everything we do, checking up on me, and never pushing me to do something I am even remotly uncomfortable with or hesistant about. You always know what to say or to do. I don't know what I did to desevre you. I don't even think someone like me deserves you at all</p>
    <p>I grew up in a family where love was never expressed, never shown, even shamed. My little sister used to say "I love you" to me all the time and then hug/kiss me and my parents riduculed her for it for so long. She would always ask me if I loved her and for somereason I just couldn't say those words back. It's not because I didn't love her, I really do, I think it's because love has been looked down upon as taboo and wrong my whole life when in reality, it is not. I think my sister stopped saying "I love you" to me a few months ago...I regret not saying it to her.</p>
    <p>The way you express love seems so natural. You're so good at expressing your love to me. You have a way with words that make my heart flutter, I could listen to you speak for hours. I don't know how to express love Iggy, but I promise I am trying. And I'll never stop trying. I love you tons baby. Its 2:37am and my eyes are closing. Will continue this tomorrow. Goodnight!</p>
